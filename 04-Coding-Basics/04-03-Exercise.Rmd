### Exercise 1
Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like `"` or `'`. By convention, `read_csv()` assumes that the quoting character will be `"`. What arguments do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame?

```{r eval=F}
"x,y  
1,'a,b'"
```

### Exercise 2
Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code? Fix the ones that you can.

> `read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")`

> `read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")`

> `read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")`

> `read_csv("a;b\n1;3")`

### Exercise 3
Take the Excel file that we just created: `myNewDatasets.xlsx`. Pick one or two sheets from it and read them into your R memory. Try to read different cuts using Excel notation discussed in the notebook.

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```
